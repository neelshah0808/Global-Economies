# Global-Economies

A C# console (.NET Core) application that uses an XML file (global_economies.xml) for data
storage and generates parameterized reports based on user inputs. The XML file contains economic
data (inflation, interest rates, unemployment) for countries and regions around the globe for all years
from 1970 up to 2021. The data are from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/inflation-interestand-unemployment-rate?resource=download. Your users should be able to view two types of tabular
reports: all types of economic information for a selected region or a specific metric (type of economic
information) for all regions. Regardless of the type of report selected, due to screen-space limitations all
reports generated will be limited to a range of years. The specific range of years should be selected by
the user. After completing this project, you should be able to apply the DOM and XPath to navigate and
retrieve information from an XML document tree.
